# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**
 * At least four different sorting algorithms
 * What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
 * How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
 * What is a stable sorting algorithm

### 0. Bubble sort 
Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);

### 1. Insertion sort
Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);

### 2. Selection sort
Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);

### 3. Quick sort
Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
